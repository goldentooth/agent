## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Rust 2024 Edition**: Latest language features and best practices
- **Async/Await**: Full Tokio integration with proper error propagation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with context preservation
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components
- **Documentation**: Rustdoc comments for all public APIs

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 compliance with PKCE
- **Transport Security**: TLS for HTTP, process isolation for stdio
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs sanitized and validated
- **Error Messages**: No sensitive information in error responses
- **Logging**: Security-relevant events logged appropriately

### Performance Targets
- **Startup Time**: <500ms for client initialization
- **Request Latency**: <100ms for typical cluster operations
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB baseline memory footprint
- **CPU Efficiency**: Async I/O to minimize CPU blocking

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each module tested in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenarios with mock servers
- **Transport Parity**: Identical test coverage for both transports
- **Error Conditions**: Comprehensive failure scenario testing
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput validation

```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Transport Abstraction**: Common trait enables testing and flexibility
- **Async-First**: All I/O operations use async/await patterns
- **Error Context**: Rich error information for debugging
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and config files
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between protocol, transport, and application layers

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Transport Complexity**: Mitigated by common abstraction and extensive testing
- **Authentication Integration**: Early prototyping with Goldentooth cluster
- **Performance Requirements**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization
- **Protocol Evolution**: Modular design enables easy MCP spec updates

### Development Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict stage boundaries and success criteria
- **Testing Complexity**: Transport-agnostic test framework
- **Integration Challenges**: Early integration testing with real MCP server

## Success Metrics
