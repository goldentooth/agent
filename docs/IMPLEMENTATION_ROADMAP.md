# Implementation Roadmap: Goldentooth Agent Development Plan

## Overview

This roadmap provides a detailed, phase-by-phase approach to implementing the Goldentooth Agent's multi-persona cluster intelligence system. Each phase builds incrementally on the previous, ensuring continuous value delivery while working toward the complete vision.

## Core Design Decisions (Based on Architectural Review Feedback)

### Character Opacity Strategy
- **No Transparent Service Mapping**: Characters like "Lady Grafana" or "Ser Velaryon" are replaced with opaque personalities like "Dr. Caudex Thorne" and "Miss Glestrine Vellum"
- **Discovery Through Investigation**: Users must determine which character represents which service through behavioral patterns, stress responses, and dialogue hints
- **Indirect Service Hints**: Characters reveal their service domains through personality quirks and reaction patterns rather than explicit naming

### Cost-Effective Monitoring Approach  
- **Periodic Pulse Checks**: 15-60 minute intervals instead of continuous real-time monitoring
- **Smart Data Proxies**: Use Uptime Kuma, batch-processed Loki logs, and Grafana summaries instead of expensive direct monitoring
- **Boredom-Driven Narratives**: When system activity is low, characters generate storylines using TVTropes integration
- **ML Health Classification**: Lightweight models categorize system states as "bored/stressed/happy/crisis"

## Development Principles

### Feedback Cycle Optimization
- **Local Testing First**: Each feature includes comprehensive local testing with mocked services
- **Simulation Environment**: Early investment in cluster simulation for rapid iteration
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated testing and validation using existing CI/CD
- **Progressive Real Cluster Integration**: Gradual introduction of real cluster interactions

### TDD-Driven Character Development
- **Personality Test Suites**: Each character personality has comprehensive behavioral tests
- **Character Consistency Validation**: Automated tests ensure dialogue and behavior consistency  
- **Evolution Regression Testing**: Verify character evolution patterns remain stable
- **Multi-Persona Integration Testing**: Validate character interactions and relationships

## Phase 1: Minimal Viable Characters (Weeks 1-8)
