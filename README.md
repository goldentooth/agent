# (Goldentooth) Agent

This is an implementation of an intelligent (very debatably) agent for my Pi Bramble/cluster, [Goldentooth](https://github.com/goldentooth/).

## AI Warning

I'm developing this project (along with the [Goldentooth MCP Server](https://github.com/goldentooth/mcp-server)) with the assistance of Claude Code. This project leans more toward "vibe coding", so the code in this repository (whether good or bad) shouldn't really be viewed as being solely my work. Also, based on my experiences thusfar, I want to make clear that this code should be considered **unsound** and **unsafe**. I generally take a great amount of care with my projects and try to code them intentionally and organically.
