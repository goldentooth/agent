## Background & Motivation

### Problem Statement

The util module addresses domain-specific util functionality that required specialized architectural solutions.

### Theoretical Foundation

#### Core Concepts

The module implements domain-specific concepts tailored to its functional requirements.

#### Design Philosophy

**Simplicity and Clarity**: Emphasizes straightforward implementations that are easy to understand and maintain.

### Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Modularity**: Designing clean interfaces that promote reusability and testability
2. **Maintainability**: Structuring code for easy modification and extension
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly connecting with other system components

### Integration & Usage

The util module integrates with the broader system through well-defined interfaces.

**Key Dependencies:**
- goldentooth_agent.core.util.maybe_await: Provides essential functionality required by this module
- asyncio: Provides essential functionality required by this module
- pytest: Provides essential functionality required by this module

**Usage Patterns:**
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are provided through the Antidote DI container
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: All public APIs use comprehensive type annotations
- **Error Propagation**: Exceptions are handled consistently with the system's error handling patterns
